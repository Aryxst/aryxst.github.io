### Context

As a pet lover and game developer, I wanted to combine my passions to create an engaging experience where players can experience the joys and challenges of pet ownership in a virtual environment.

### Features & Mechanics

The Virtual Pet Simulator features a variety of pets to choose from, each with their own unique traits and personalities. Players must feed, groom, and play with their pets to keep them happy and healthy. Training mini-games help improve pet skills and unlock new abilities. Real-time interactions and dynamic behavior create a lifelike experience.

### Technologies

Developed using Phaser, a fast, free, and fun open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games. Backend services are managed with Node.js and MongoDB, ensuring scalability and real-time synchronization for multiplayer features.
