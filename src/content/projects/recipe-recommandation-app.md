### Context

As a foodie and developer, I wanted to create a platform that simplifies the process of finding and sharing delicious recipes based on individual tastes and preferences.

### Features & Mechanics

The Recipe Recommendation App utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and suggest recipes tailored to their dietary restrictions, flavor profiles, and cooking skill level. Users can explore a vast database of recipes, save their favorites, and create personalized meal plans. Integrated shopping lists streamline the ingredient procurement process, making cooking more accessible and enjoyable.

### Technologies

Built with React Native for cross-platform compatibility, ensuring seamless user experiences on both iOS and Android devices. Backend infrastructure powered by AWS Lambda and DynamoDB enables scalable and efficient data storage and retrieval. AI capabilities are enhanced through integration with TensorFlow for recipe recommendation algorithms.
