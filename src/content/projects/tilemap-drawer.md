### Context

I've always been fascinated by tile-based games and wanted to develop a tool that simplifies the process of creating and editing tilemaps for JavaScript games.

I created this tool to address the need for a user-friendly interface for designing custom levels and game environments.

### Features & Mechanics

The JavaScript Tilemap Drawer provides a range of features to facilitate the creation and editing of tilemaps. Users can easily place and remove tiles, define collision areas, and customize tile properties.

The tool supports various tileset formats and provides options for importing and exporting tilemap data, allowing seamless integration with game development workflows.

### Technologies

The JavaScript Tilemap Drawer is built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages libraries such as PixiJS for rendering and interaction, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

Data management is handled using local storage or cloud-based solutions, ensuring that users can save and access their tilemap projects from any device.
