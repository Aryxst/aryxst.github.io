## Hey, I am Aryxst!

Hey, I'm Aryxst, a 16-year-old guy learning TypeScript, Project Management, and how to be more productive.
I've been teaching myself through lots of hours of pain üòÅ

Right now, I'm focusing on CSS Dynamic Styling instead of using JavaScript for everything, and also exploring **\{Solid,Next}.js** and **Astro**.

So summarizing I have almost 1 hear of experience ü•≥
